# AI-Powered Definitions and Explanations Feature

## Overview

This feature provides **balanced, multi-perspective AI-generated definitions** for technical terms and controversial concepts identified in podcast transcripts. The system now generates appropriate definitions based on topic type: factual definitions for technical terms, balanced definitions for controversial topics, and descriptive definitions for general concepts.

## ‚ú® Major Enhancement: Balanced Definitions for Controversial Topics

### üéØ Problem Solved
- **Bias Issue**: Previous AI definitions showed one-sided perspectives on controversial topics like DEI
- **User Feedback**: "DEI defined favorably when DEI is proven to have failed and caused more harm than good"
- **Solution**: Implemented balanced definition system that presents multiple perspectives for contested topics

### üí° New Definition Types

#### üìö Factual Definitions (Technical Terms)
- **For**: Technical terms, tools, methodologies
- **Style**: Objective, factual explanations
- **Example**: "machine learning": "A subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed."

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced Definitions (Controversial Topics)
- **For**: Political concepts, social issues, contested topics
- **Style**: Multi-perspective, acknowledges different viewpoints
- **Example**: "diversity equity inclusion": "A framework aimed at creating fair treatment and full participation for all people. Supporters argue it addresses systemic inequalities and promotes fairness, while critics contend it can lead to reverse discrimination and divisive identity politics."

#### üìù Descriptive Definitions (General Concepts)
- **For**: General concepts, neutral topics
- **Style**: Neutral, descriptive explanations
- **Example**: "leadership": "The ability to guide, influence, and direct others toward achieving common goals."

## Key Features

### üîç Intelligent Topic Classification
The system automatically detects controversial terms and applies appropriate definition strategies:

```typescript
// Controversial terms that need balanced definitions
const controversialTerms = [
  'dei', 'diversity equity inclusion', 'climate change', 'socialism', 
  'capitalism', 'feminism', 'critical race theory', 'gun control',
  'abortion', 'immigration', 'welfare', 'cancel culture', etc.
];
```

### üé® Visual Definition Type Indicators
- **üìö Blue Icon**: Factual definitions for technical terms
- **‚öñÔ∏è Scale Icon**: Balanced definitions for controversial topics  
- **üìù Note Icon**: Descriptive definitions for general concepts
- **Special Styling**: Balanced definitions have amber border highlighting

### üîÑ Enhanced AI Prompting
Different prompts for different topic types:

```typescript
// For controversial terms
"Provide a balanced definition that acknowledges different perspectives. 
Format: '[Basic description]. Supporters argue [positive view], 
while critics contend [negative view].'"

// For technical terms  
"Provide factual, objective definitions explaining what the term means technically."
```

## Implementation Details

### Backend Enhancements

#### Topic Classification System
```typescript
private isControversialTerm(keyword: string): boolean {
  const lowerKeyword = keyword.toLowerCase();
  return this.controversialTerms.has(lowerKeyword) || 
         Array.from(this.controversialTerms).some(term => 
           lowerKeyword.includes(term) || term.includes(lowerKeyword)
         );
}
```

#### Enhanced Definition Generation
```typescript
const systemPrompt = isControversial
  ? `Provide balanced, multi-perspective definitions. Present multiple viewpoints fairly without taking sides.`
  : `Provide factual, objective definitions for technical terms.`;
```

### Frontend Enhancements

#### Definition Type Metadata
```typescript
export interface KeywordHighlight {
  // ... existing fields ...
  definitionType?: 'factual' | 'balanced' | 'descriptive';
}
```

#### Visual Indicators
- CSS styling differentiates definition types
- Tooltips show definition type with appropriate icons
- Legend explains different definition types
